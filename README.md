Authors: Hayley Ma, Lauren Sung, Catherine Lu, Samantha Pincus

This repository includes:
- README.md
- Data folder with the tidied dataset (.csv)
- R folder with three .qmd files for tidying, exploratory data analysis (data wrangling), and overall analysis (visualizations)

This project aims to answer the main question: How is the popularity of a movie influenced by factors such as budget, genre, director, or leading actor? The analysis was conducted using the Movie Industry dataset including 6820 movies from 1986-2016, sourced from IMDb. This provides insight into how different factors impact the IMDb scores and total revenues of the movies in the dataset.
